# 🌊 Flood Prediction System using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

Floods are one of the most devastating natural disasters, causing loss of life, damage to infrastructure, and economic disruption. This project aims to predict the possibility of flood occurrence using Machine Learning techniques based on rainfall data.

The system analyzes monthly and seasonal rainfall values and predicts whether there is a likelihood of flooding. The trained Machine Learning model is integrated into a Flask web application that allows users to enter rainfall values and receive instant flood predictions.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict flood risk using rainfall data.
- Compare multiple Machine Learning algorithms.
- Select the best-performing model.
- Deploy the trained model using Flask.
- Provide an easy-to-use web interface for prediction.

## 📂 Dataset

**Dataset Name**

Rainfall in India (1901–2015)

The dataset contains rainfall records including:

- Monthly rainfall (January–December)
- Seasonal rainfall
- Annual rainfall
- State
- Year

Missing values were handled using Mean Imputation.

A Flood target column was created based on annual rainfall threshold for model training.
